This code is a simple webscraper that utilises the Selenium library to pull information from a website.
This particular scraper aggregates countries and information about them.

To Run:
in order to run the code you need to have chromedriver installed on your machine. Once Chromedriver is installed
add the path to chromedriver into the code at line(7):

path = "YOUR PATH TO CHROMEDRIVER"

there is an example of what the excel sheet looks like after it is done scraping inside the directory as well if you do
not wish to run the code.
